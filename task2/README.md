📊 Tips Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the classic "Tips" dataset, which records information about restaurant bills, tips, and dining habits.

✨ Project Overview

The goal of this EDA is to uncover patterns and relationships within the Tips dataset, providing insights into factors influencing tipping behavior. Visualizations and basic statistical summaries were used to understand the distributions of key variables and their interconnections.

🔍 Key Insights

Tip vs. Bill: A strong positive correlation exists between the total_bill and tip amount; larger bills generally result in larger tips.

Weekend Popularity: Saturday and Sunday evenings (dinner service) are the busiest times, receiving the highest count of tips. Fridays are the least busy.

Tipping by Day: While median tips are similar across most days, Sunday shows a slightly higher median tip amount. Saturday has the most high-value tip outliers.

Gender & Tips: Males tend to leave a slightly higher average tip, but the difference is not statistically significant.

Smoking Status: Non-smokers account for a larger proportion of the overall customer base and are more frequently associated with higher total bills and tips.

Dining Times: The restaurant primarily serves lunch on Thursdays and predominantly dinner on weekends (Saturday & Sunday). Fridays see a mix, with slightly more dinner service.
